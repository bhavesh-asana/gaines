# Gaines

Gaines is a scientific architecture that employs computational systems to self-integrate, creating a knowledge resource through deep learning techniques. These techniques enable it to understand and generate human-like text based on input. It can engage in conversations, answer questions, provide explanations, and assist in exchanging information.

Gaines is built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, utilizes deep learning methods. Currently, it is pre-trained on self-integrated text data from various file formats (.pdf, .txt, .doc, .docx), enabling it to comprehend context and generate coherent, relevant responses across diverse topics.
